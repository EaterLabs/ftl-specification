           Faster-Than-Light Streaming Protocl Specification
                       draft-ftl-specification-00

Abstract

   With the demise of Microsoft's Mixer, the future of the Faster-Than-
   Light (FTL) streaming protocol has been left in doubt.  As the
   Internet's first practical subsecond streaming protocol, several
   successors to Mixer have decided to re-implement FTL from the
   original SDK and notes.  While Mixer's original FTL specification had
   a de-facto specification in the form of ftl-sdk, the source code was
   in-complete, and several aspects of the FTL were left undocumented.

   In an effort to keep FTL viable and cross-service compatible, this
   specification denotes a canonical implementation of FTL, handshake
   protocols, WebRTC notes, and all relevant information as relating to
   FTL with the hope that FTL may still be continued as a vechile for
   low latency video streaming over the Internet.

1.  Introduction and Overview

   This specification covers several components of the FTL protocol
   stream, and is primarily derieved from the implementation used at
   Mixer and the freely available source code in ftl-sdk.  This document
   details the handshaking protocol known as Charon, the SRTP ingest
   behaviors, and defines a recommended ingest->endpoint streaming
   protocol, as well as notes in regards to implementation of the last
   mile WebRTC connections.

   FTL was specifically designed with the following objectives in mind
   which is must handle at all times.

   o  Real-world 500 millsecond delay for streamer to receiver broadcast
      under normal cirmstances at 30 FPS or more

      *  At the time of it's implementation, 720p streaming was
         considered the best possible for most users, however,
         advancements in technology have allowed for 1080p streaming.

   o  That FTL has be technology neutral; it should be able to use any
      video or audio codec as supported by WebRTC (or another last mile
      technology) independently.  The original FTL implemntation used
      VP8 and Opus, later ones used H.264, keeping with the original
      intent.

   o  Use of standards based technology for use in a web browser with no
      additional software or downloads for viewers
