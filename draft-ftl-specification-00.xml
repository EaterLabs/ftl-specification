    <abstract>
      <t>With the demise of Microsoft's Mixer, the future of the Faster-Than-Light (FTL) streaming protocol has been left in doubt.
        As the Internet's first practical subsecond streaming protocol, several successors to Mixer have decided to re-implement
          FTL from the original SDK and notes. While Mixer's original FTL specification had a de-facto specification in the form of
          ftl-sdk, the source code was in-complete, and several aspects of the FTL were left undocumented.
      </t>
      <t>In an effort to keep FTL viable and cross-service compatible, this specification denotes a canonical implementation of FTL,
        handshake protocols, WebRTC notes, and all relevant information as relating to FTL with the hope that FTL may still be continued
        as a vechile for low latency video streaming over the Internet.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>This specification covers several components of the FTL protocol stream, and is primarily derieved from the implementation used
        at Mixer and the freely available source code in ftl-sdk. This document details the handshaking protocol known as Charon, the
      SRTP ingest behaviors, and defines a recommended ingest->endpoint streaming protocol, as well as notes in regards to implementation
    of the last mile WebRTC connections.</t>

      <t>FTL was specifically designed with the following objectives in mind which is must handle at all times.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            Real-world 500 millsecond delay for streamer to receiver broadcast under normal cirmstances at 30 FPS or more
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>At the time of it's implementation, 720p streaming was considered the best possible for most users, however,
              advancements in technology have allowed for 1080p streaming.</t>
            </list>
          </t>
          <t>That FTL has be technology neutral; it should be able to use any video or audio codec as supported by WebRTC
             (or another last mile technology) independently. The original FTL implemntation used VP8 and Opus, later ones
             used H.264, keeping with the original intent.</t>
          <t>It is expected that to reduce latency, an FTL deployment has multiple ingest and points of presenses for client connections.
            A stream connects to one ingest point, and then data is routed to points of presence as necessary.</t>
          <t>FTL end-points must support being behind anycast, as well as use of STUN, and TURN if necessary</t>
          <t>Use of standards based technology for use in a web browser with no additional software or downloads for viewers</t>
        </list>
      </t>

      <t>As originally designed, the following criticera were also kept in mind, although not realized at least during the initial
        implementation phases.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Use of IPv6
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>IPv6 deployment and usage was considered highly desirable for multiple reasons, primarily to simplify
              routing and mandated multicast support; as implemented, there should be no known IPv6 problems, but
              the protocol never tested either.</t>

    <section title="Charon Negotiation Protocol">
      <t>Charon handles negotiation of RTP streams to Styx, and acts as an out of band signaling
        method for FTL stream behavior. The Charon connection MUST be kept-alive at all times as
        a TCP/IP connection on port 8084 (MC: should apply for IANA number). If the TCP/IP connection
        is reset, the broadcaster MUST assume that the ingest point of presence has become unavailable,
        and begin clean-up and teardown. Likewise, the ingest daemon MUST begin teardown and disregard
        any UDP traffic from the streamer upon Charon connection loss. 
      </t>
      <t>The Charon protocol is built upon ASCII verbs with optional arguments. The lifecycle of this
        connection under normal circumstances is as follows.
      </t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Broadcaster connects to ingest on TCP/IP 8084</t>
          <t>Broadcaster gets HMAC authentication</t>
          <t>Broadcaster generates HMAC authentication based off streamer connection ID and channel idea</t>
          <t>Broadcaster sends CONNECT, combined with stream paramters.</t>
          <t>Ingest sends FTL_OK or FTL_REJECT based on settings</t>
          <t>If FLT_OK, Broadcaster sends RTP streams to the media port indicated by the ingest</t>
          <t>Broadcaster starts RTP streams per Ingests response</t>
          <t>Every five seconds, a PING response is sent, ingest replies with 201</t>
          <t>Broadcaster sends DISCONNECT for orderly shutdown</t>
        </list> 
      </t>
    <section title="Message Format">
      <t>TBH </t>
      <section title="On Linebreaks">
        <t>The reference implementation of FTL uses the message signature '\r\n\r\n' as an end of line marker.
          This is an intentional implementation detail due to an unintentional similarity between FTL's CONNECT message,
          and the HTTP CONNECT proxy command, and Microsoft discovered that some commercial firewalls would intercept
          Charon's messages. The original justification was left as this comment in ftl_helpers.c</t>
        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[
/*
  Please note that throughout the code, we send "\r\n\r\n", where a normal
  newline ("\n") would suffice. This is done due to some firewalls / 
  anti-malware systems not passing our packets through when we don't
  send those double-windows-newlines. They seem to incorrectly detect
  our protocol as HTTP.
*/
            ]]></artwork>
        </figure>
      <t>A problem however arises that earlier implementations of FTL used "\n" as a newline indicator.
        While it is unlikely that any of these legacy FTL clients are still in use, clients and ingests
        must use the following behaviors</t>

      <t>Charon servers MUST disregard any empty newline, and treat "\r\n" and "\n" as identical for the purposes
        of message parsing. In effect, all the following are the same.</t>
  <figure>
    <artwork><![CDATA[
CONNECT 1234_hash\n
Option1: 1234\n
Option2: 1234\n
.\n

CONNECT 1234_hash\r\n
Option1: 1234\r\n

Option2: 1234\r\n\r\n
.\r\n\
]]></artwork>
  </figure>
  <t>Charon clients are RECOMMENDED to use '\r\n\r\n' when transmitting commands over clear text, but MAY use '\n', or '\r\n'</t>
