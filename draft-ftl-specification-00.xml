    <abstract>
      <t>With the demise of Microsoft's Mixer, the future of the Faster-Than-Light (FTL) streaming protocol has been left in doubt.
        As the Internet's first practical subsecond streaming protocol, several successors to Mixer have decided to re-implement
          FTL from the original SDK and notes. While Mixer's original FTL specification had a de-facto specification in the form of
          ftl-sdk, the source code was in-complete, and several aspects of the FTL were left undocumented.
      </t>
      <t>In an effort to keep FTL viable and cross-service compatible, this specification denotes a canonical implementation of FTL,
        handshake protocols, WebRTC notes, and all relevant information as relating to FTL with the hope that FTL may still be continued
        as a vechile for low latency video streaming over the Internet.
      </t>
    </abstract>
  </front>
  <middle>
    <section title="Introduction and Overview">
      <t>This specification covers several components of the FTL protocol stream, and is primarily derieved from the implementation used
        at Mixer and the freely available source code in ftl-sdk. This document details the handshaking protocol known as Charon, the
      SRTP ingest behaviors, and defines a recommended ingest->endpoint streaming protocol, as well as notes in regards to implementation
    of the last mile WebRTC connections.</t>

      <t>FTL was specifically designed with the following objectives in mind which is must handle at all times.</t>
      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>Real-world 500 millsecond delay for streamer to receiver broadcast under normal cirmstances at 30 FPS or more
          <list style="symbols">
            <t>At the time of it's implementation, 720p streaming was considered the best possible for most users, however,
              advancements in technology have allowed for 1080p streaming.</t>
          </list></t>
          <t>That FTL has be technology neutral; it should be able to use any video or audio codec as supported by WebRTC
             (or another last mile technology) independently. The original FTL implemntation used VP8 and Opus, later ones
             used H.264, keeping with the original intent.</t>
          <t>Use of standards based technology for use in a web browser with no additional software or downloads for viewers</t>
        </list>
